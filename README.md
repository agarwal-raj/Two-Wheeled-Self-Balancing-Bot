## Approach

### Modeling, Simulating and, Testing 
1. Fork the repo on GitHub: Use the button at the top right.
2. Clone the project to your machine

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/${your_username}/Two-Wheeled-Self-Balancing-Bot.git
    ```

3. Commit your solutions to your own branch: 

    Create a new branch by

    ```bash
    git checkout -b ${your_branch_name}
    ```

4. Push your work back up to your fork: 

    Navigate to the top-level repo directory and:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push origin ${your_branch_name} 
    ```

5. Update the repo on your system by [setting an upstream](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) to the `main` branch of **this** repository and then running -  
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    ```
