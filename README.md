## Approach: Model, Estimate, Control, Simulate and, Test
 

### MODELLING:
        - Mathematical Model (MATLAB & Simulink)
                    - Linearized and Non Linearized
                    - Limited to Inverted cart- pendulum system
        - Simscape Model
                    - Can include disturbanes and noise
                    - Not limited to Inverted cart- pendulum system
                    - Can add more realistic features to the Bot
### ESTIMATE & CONTROL:
        - Kalman- filter
        - PID & LQR
        - Linear Quadratic Gaussian Approach
        - Dicrete vs. Continuous Control
### SIMULATE & TEST:
        - Convergence Plots
        - Robustness & Performance
        - MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape
